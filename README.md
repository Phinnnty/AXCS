# AXCS

 AXCS is a voice recognition script that allows users to open webpages, run applications, and execute certain commands with their voice. 

 When the script is active, users can say "Open Facebook" to trigger their preferred web browser to open up Facebook. 


AXCS Voice Recognition is the main script that listens to the user.

AXCS Voice Commands are a library script that allows the user to execute specific commands i.e. "Open Facebook"

AXCS Source is a JSON document where the names of commands are saved. It may be redundant.

AXCS GUI is a buggy mess, that hopes to act as a GUI for the user so that they can freely create, edit, or manipulate their phrases and commands without having to use a notepad or IDE to make changes.


 
AXCS relies on the following libraries to work

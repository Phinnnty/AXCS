# AXCS
 AXCS is a voice recognition script that allows users to open webpages, run applications, and execute certain commands with their voice. 

 When the script is active, users can say "Open Facebook" to trigger their preferred web browser to open up Facebook. 

 

AXCS relies on the following libraries to work
JSON - https://github.com/cocobelgica/AutoHotkey-JSON/blob/master/JSON.ahk
